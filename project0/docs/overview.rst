   The ``overview.rst`` provides a high-level introduction to the project. This introduction typically includes the project's goals, the problems it aims to solve, and the intended audience or users.

2. **Structure and Navigation**:
   It offers a roadmap of the project's documentation, outlining the structure and helping users navigate through various sections. By summarizing the contents and linking to more detailed documents, it ensures that users can easily find the information they need.

3. **Context and Background**:
   The document sets the context for the project by providing background information, historical context, and any prerequisite knowledge required to understand the subsequent documentation. This helps users to get up to speed with the project's domain and scope.

4. **Key Features and Highlights**:
   ``overview.rst`` highlights the key features and functionalities of the project, giving users a quick glance at what to expect. This can include major components, modules, or services provided by the project.
